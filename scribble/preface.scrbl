@title[#:style favicon #:tag "preface"]{Preface}

In this book (well, let's say it is a book), I publish pieces of
drafts from time to time. Please notice the order of the essays: they
are arranged from old to new. Although this arrangement doesn't follow
the convention of a news website or personal blog, it makes it more
like a book.
